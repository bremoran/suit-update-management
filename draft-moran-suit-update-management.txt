Update Management Extensions for Software Updates for Internet of Things
                            (SUIT) Manifests
                 draft-moran-suit-update-management-00

Abstract

   This specification describes extensions to the SUIT manifest format
   defined in [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest].  These extensions allow an
   update author, update distributor or device operator to more
   precisely control the distribution and installation of updates to IoT
   devices.  These extensions also provide a mechanism to inform a
   management system of Software Identifier and Software Bill Of
   Materials information about an updated device.

1.  Introduction

   Full management of software updates for unattended, connected
   devices, such as Internet of Things devices requires a cooperation
   between the update author(s) and management, distribution, policy
   enforcement, and auditing systems.  This specification provides the
   extensions to the SUIT manifest ([I-D.ietf-suit-manifest]) that
   enable an author to coordinate with these other systems.  These
   extensions enable authors to instruct devices to examine update

   priority, local update authorisation, update lifetime, and system
   properties.  They also enable devices to report and distributors to
   collect Software Bill of Materials information.

   Extensions in this specification are OPTIONAL to implment and
   OPTIONAL to include in manifests unless otherwise designated.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Additionally, the following terminology is used throughout this
   document:

   *  SUIT: Software Update for the Internet of Things, also the IETF
      working group for this standard.

3.  Extension Metadata

   Some additional metadata makes management of SUIT updates easier: a
   CoSWID can enable a

3.1.  suit-coswid

   suit-coswid is a member of the suit-manifest.  It contains a Concise
   Software Identifier (CoSWID) as defined in [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid].
   This element SHOULD be made severable so that it can be discarded by
   the Recipient or an intermediary if it is not required by the
   Recipient.

   suit-coswid typically requires no processing by the Recipient.
   However all Recipients MUST NOT fail if a suit-coswid is present.

   suit-coswid is RECOMMENDED to implement and RECOMMENDED to include in
   manifests.

   TODO: CoRIM might be a preferable alternative to CoSWID.  TODO:
   Should CoMID be offered as an alternative to Vendor ID/Class ID?
   TODO: Should there be a CoMID namespace identifier for UUIDs?

Internet-Draft      SUIT Update Management Extensions       October 2021


3.2.  text-version-required

   suit-text-version-required is used to represent a version-based
   dependency on suit-parameter-version as described in Section 4.4 and
   Section 5.5.  To describe a version dependency, a Manifest Author
   SHOULD populate the suit-text map with a SUIT_Component_Identifier
   key for the dependency component, and place in the corresponding map
   a suit-text-version-required key with a free text expression that is
   representative of the version constraints placed on the dependency.
   This text SHOULD be expressive enough that a device operator can be
   expected to understand the dependency.  This is a free text field and
   there are no specific formatting rules.

   By way of example only, to express a dependency on a component "['x',
   'y']", where the version should be any v1.x later than v1.2.5, but
   not v2.0 or above, the author would add the following structure to
   the suit-text element.  Note that this text is in cbor-diag notation.

   [h'78',h'79'] : {
       7 : ">=1.2.5,<2"
   }

4.  Extension Parameters

   Several parameters are needed to define the behaviour of the commands
   specified in Section 5.  These parameters follow the same
   considerations as defined in SUIT_Parameters, Section 8.4.8 of
   [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest]

Internet-Draft      SUIT Update Management Extensions       October 2021


4.1.  suit-parameter-use-before

   An expiry date for the use of the manifest encoded as the positive
   integer number of seconds since 1970-01-01.  Implementations that use
   this parameter MUST use a 64-bit internal representation of the
   integer.  Used with Section 5.1

4.2.  suit-parameter-minimum-battery

   This parameter sets the minimum battery level in mWh.  This parameter
   is encoded as a positive integer.  Used with suit-condition-minimum-
   battery (Section 5.3).

4.3.  suit-parameter-update-priority

   This parameter sets the priority of the update.  This parameter is
   encoded as an integer.  It is used along with suit-condition-update-
   authorized (Section 5.4) to ask an application for permission to
   initiate an update.  This does not constitute a privilege inversion
   because an explicit request for authorization has been provided by
   the Update Authority in the form of the suit-condition-update-
   authorized command.

   Applications MAY define their own meanings for the update priority.
   For example, critical reliability & vulnerability fixes MAY be given
   negative numbers, while bug fixes MAY be given small positive
   numbers, and feature additions MAY be given larger positive numbers,
   which allows an application to make an informed decision about
   whether and when to allow an update to proceed.

4.4.  suit-parameter-version

   Indicates allowable versions for the specified component.  Allowable
   versions can be specified, either with a list or with range matching.
   This parameter is compared with version asserted by the current
   component when suit-condition-version (Section 5.5) is invoked.  The
   current component may assert the current version in many ways,
   including storage in a parameter storage database, in a metadata
   object, or in a known location within the component itself.

   The component version can be compared as:

   *  Greater.

   *  Greater or Equal.

   *  Equal.

Internet-Draft      SUIT Update Management Extensions       October 2021


   *  Lesser or Equal.

   *  Lesser.

   Versions are encoded as a CBOR list of integers.  Comparisons are
   done on each integer in sequence.  Comparison stops after all
   integers in the list defined by the manifest have been consumed OR
   after a non-equal match has occurred.  For example, if the manifest
   defines a comparison, "Equal [1]", then this will match all version
   sequences starting with 1.  If a manifest defines both "Greater or
   Equal [1,0]" and "Lesser [1,10]", then it will match versions 1.0.x
   up to, but not including 1.10.

   While the exact encoding of versions is application-defined, semantic
   versions map conveniently.  For example,

   *  1.2.3 = [1,2,3].

   *  1.2-rc3 = [1,2,-1,3].

   *  1.2-beta = [1,2,-2].

   *  1.2-alpha = [1,2,-3].

   *  1.2-alpha4 = [1,2,-3,4].

   suit-condition-version is OPTIONAL to implement.

   Versions SHOULD be provided as follows:

   1.  The first integer represents the major number.  This indicates
       breaking changes to the component.

   2.  The second integer represents the minor number.  This is
       typically reserved for new features or large, non-breaking
       changes.

   3.  The third integer is the patch version.  This is typically
       reserved for bug fixes.

   4.  The fourth integer is the build number.

Internet-Draft      SUIT Update Management Extensions       October 2021


   Where Alpha (-3), Beta (-2), and Release Candidate (-1) are used,
   they are inserted as a negative number between Minor and Patch
   numbers.  This allows these releases to compare correctly with final
   releases.  For example, Version 2.0, RC1 should be lower than Version
   2.0.0 and higher than any Version 1.x.  By encoding RC as -1, this
   works correctly: [2,0,-1,1] compares as lower than [2,0,0].
   Similarly, beta (-2) is lower than RC and alpha (-3) is lower than
   RC.

4.5.  suit-parameter-wait-info

   suit-directive-wait (Section 5.6) directs the manifest processor to
   pause until a specified event occurs.  The suit-parameter-wait-info
   encodes the parameters needed for the directive.

   The exact implementation of the pause is implementation-defined.  For
   example, this could be done by blocking on a semaphore, registering
   an event handler and suspending the manifest processor, polling for a
   notification, or aborting the update entirely, then restarting when a
   notification is received.

   suit-parameter-wait-info is encoded as a map of wait events.  When
   ALL wait events are satisfied, the Manifest Processor continues.  The
   wait events currently defined are described in the following table.

5.1.  suit-condition-use-before

   Verify that the current time is BEFORE the specified time. suit-
   condition-use-before is used to specify the last time at which an
   update should be installed.  The recipient evaluates the current time
   against the suit-parameter-use-before parameter (Section 4.1), which
   must have already been set as a parameter, encoded as seconds after
   1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.  Timestamp conditions MUST be evaluated in
   64 bits, regardless of encoded CBOR size. suit-condition-use-before
   is OPTIONAL to implement.

5.2.  suit-condition-image-not-match

   Verify that the current component does not match the suit-parameter-
   image-digest (Section 8.4.8.6 of [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest]).  If no
   digest is specified, the condition fails. suit-condition-image-not-
   match is OPTIONAL to implement.

5.3.  suit-condition-minimum-battery

   suit-condition-minimum-battery provides a mechanism to test a
   Recipient's battery level before installing an update.  This
   condition is primarily for use in primary-cell applications, where
   the battery is only ever discharged.  For batteries that are charged,
   suit-directive-wait is more appropriate, since it defines a "wait"
   until the battery level is sufficient to install the update. suit-
   condition-minimum-battery is specified in mWh. suit-condition-
   minimum-battery is OPTIONAL to implement. suit-condition-minimum-
   battery consumes suit-parameter-minimum-battery (Section 4.2).

5.4.  suit-condition-update-authorized

   Request Authorization from the application and fail if not
   authorized.  This can allow a user to decline an update. suit-
   parameter-update-priority (Section 4.3) provides an integer priority
   level that the application can use to determine whether or not to
   authorize the update.  Priorities are application defined. suit-
   condition-update-authorized is OPTIONAL to implement.

5.5.  suit-condition-version

   suit-condition-version allows comparing versions of firmware.
   Verifying image digests is preferred to version checks because
   digests are more precise. suit-condition-version examines a
   component's version against the version info specified in suit-
   parameter-version (Section 4.4)

5.6.  suit-directive-wait

   suit-directive-wait directs the manifest processor to pause until a
   specified event occurs.  Some possible events include:

   1.  Authorization

   2.  External Power

   3.  Network availability

   4.  Other Device Firmware Version

   5.  Time

   6.  Time of Day

   7.  Day of Week
